# tfe_outputs

This data source is used to retrieve the state outputs for a given workspace. It enables output values in one Terraform configuration to be used in another.

As the outputs retrieved from a different workspace may contain sensitive information in the context of that workspace, the `values` attribute of this data source is statically marked as [sensitive](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/outputs.html#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output).



## Schema

### Required

- `organization` (String)  The name of the organization.
- `workspace` (String) The name of the workspace.

### Optional

- `values` (Dynamic, Sensitive) The current output values for the specified workspace.

### Read-Only
