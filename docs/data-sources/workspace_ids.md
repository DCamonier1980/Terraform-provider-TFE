data "tfe_workspace_ids" "app-frontend" {
  names        = ["app-frontend-prod", "app-frontend-dev1", "app-frontend-staging"]
  organization = "my-org-name"
}

data "tfe_workspace_ids" "all" {
  names        = ["*"]
  organization = "my-org-name"
}

data "tfe_workspace_ids" "prod-apps" {
  tag_names    = ["prod", "app", "aws"]
  organization = "my-org-name"

## Schema

### Required

- `organization` (String) Name of the organization.

### Optional

- `exclude_tags` (Set of String) A list of tag names to exclude when searching.
- `names` (List of String) A list of workspace names to search for. Names that don't match a real workspace will be omitted from the results, but are not an error.

  To select _all_ workspaces for an organization, provide a list with a single asterisk, like `["*"]`. No other use of wildcards is supported.
- `tag_names` (List of String) A list of tag names to search for.

### Read-Only

- `full_names` (Map of String) A map of workspace names and their full names, which look like `<ORGANIZATION>/<WORKSPACE>`.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `ids` (Map of String) A map of workspace names and their opaque, immutable IDs, which look like `ws-<RANDOM STRING>`.
