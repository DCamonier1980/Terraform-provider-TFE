# tfe_slug

This data source is used to represent configuration files on a local filesystem intended to be uploaded to Terraform Cloud/Enterprise, in lieu of those files being sourced from a configured VCS provider.

A unique checksum is generated for the specified local directory, which allows resources such as `tfe_policy_set` track the files and upload a new gzip compressed tar file containing configuration files (a Terraform slug) when those files change.

## Example Usage 

```terraform
data "tfe_slug" "test" {
  source_path = "policies/my-policy-set"
}

resource "tfe_policy_set" "test" {
  name          = "my-policy-set"
  organization  = "my-org-name"

  // reference the tfe_slug data source.
  slug = data.tfe_slug.test
}
```
