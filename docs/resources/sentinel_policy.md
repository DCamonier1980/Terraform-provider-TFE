# tfe_sentinel_policy

Sentinel Policy as Code is an embedded policy as code framework integrated with Terraform Enterprise.

 Policies are configured on a per-organization level and are organized and grouped into policy sets, which define the workspaces on which policies are enforced during runs.

 ~> **NOTE:** Managing policies and policy sets individually is a [deprecated feature in Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/sentinel/manage-policies?_ga=2.94174173.1392855715.1658762101-1323299352.1652184430#policies-and-policy-sets), and we recommend always using versioned policy sets to manage policies.

## Example Usage 

```terraform
resource "tfe_sentinel_policy" "test" {
  name         = "my-policy-name"
  description  = "This policy always passes"
  organization = "my-org-name"
  policy       = "main = rule { true }"
  enforce_mode = "hard-mandatory"
}
```
