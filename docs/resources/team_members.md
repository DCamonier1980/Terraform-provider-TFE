The tfeteammember team_member.html resource can be used multiple times as it manages the team membership for a single user.  The tfeteammembers team_members.html resource, on the other hand, is used to manage all team memberships for a specific team and can only be used once.

# tfe_team_members

Manages users in a team.

 ~> **NOTE** On managing team memberships: Terraform currently provides three resources for managing team memberships. The [tfe_team_organization_member](team_organization_member.html) resource is the preferred way. The [tfe_team_member](team_member.html) resource can be used multiple times as it manages the team membership for a single user.  The [tfe_team_members](team_members.html) resource, on the other hand, is used to manage all team memberships for a specific team and can only be used once. All three resources cannot be used for the same team simultaneously.

## Example Usage 

```terraform
resource "tfe_team" "test" {
  name         = "my-team-name"
  organization = "my-org-name"
}

resource "tfe_team_members" "test" {
  team_id   = tfe_team.test.id
  usernames = ["admin", "sander"]
}
```
