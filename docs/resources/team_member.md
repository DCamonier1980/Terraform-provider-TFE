# tfe_team_member

Add or remove a user from a team.

 ~> **NOTE** On managing team memberships: Terraform currently provides three resources for managing team memberships.

The [tfe_team_member](team_member.html) resource can be used multiple times as it manages the team membership for a single user.  The [tfe_team_members](team_members.html) resource, on the other hand, is used to manage all team memberships for a specific team and can only be used once. All three resources cannot be used for the same team simultaneously.

## Example Usage 

```terraform
resource "tfe_team" "test" {
  name         = "my-team-name"
  organization = "my-org-name"
}

resource "tfe_team_member" "test" {
  team_id  = tfe_team.test.id
  username = "sander"
}
