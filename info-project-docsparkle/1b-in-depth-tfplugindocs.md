## More Details on tfplugindocs

basic template : 
- resources.md.tmpl and data-sources.md.tmpl contain basic (fallback) templates that apply to any resource/datasource generated by tfplugindocs IF a custom template does not exist
- .Description checks if a general description (within return &schema.Resource) exists within the "tfe" directory resource schema 
- .HasExample checks the "examples/resources" OR "examples/data-sources" directory for a subdirectory named "tfe_resourcename) and a .tf file within that subdirectory that 
contains the example code snippet
- .HasImport similarly checks for a .sh file
- .SchemaMarkdown checks for attribute descriptions within  "tfe" directory schema

custom template: 
- must make a sresourcename.tmpl file within the templates/resources directory
- add any additional headings, notes, functions, etc.
- if a custom template exists, it will be used over the basic/fallback


## Gotchas! (Details to watch out for)
- Basic/Fallback templates are the default for all resources/datasources without a custom template. Thus, a change to them will apply to many
- {{if .HasExample}} and {{.HasImport}} do not work for Custom templates and must be removed
- {{ printf "{{tffile %q}}" .ExampleFile }} and {{ printf "{{codefile \"shell\" %q}}" .ImportFile }} should be replaced by {{ tffile "examples path here" }} and {{ codefile "shell" "import path here" }} for Custom templates
- Note boxes can be added to any schema description using  "\n\n ~>" without using a custom template. However, any notes that are not tied to a description must be defined in a custom template
- ~> creates a warning note while -> creates an info note 
- formatting notes for import statements have been changed to a comment within the import.sh code snippet to avoid making custom templates for each one
- Nested attribute descriptions for datasources are not currently appearing
