  Get output values from another organization/workspace.

# Data Source: tfe_outputs

This data source is used to retrieve the state outputs for a given workspace.
It enables output values in one Terraform configuration to be used in another.

The `values` attribute has been defined as sensitive because the workspace
outputs may contain sensitive values and the provider protocol does not support
marking values as [sensitive](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/outputs.html#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output) after this information is known. You can access
the subset of non-sensitive outputs using the `nonsensitive_values` attribute.

## Example Usage

Using the `tfe_outputs` data source, the outputs `foo` and `bar` can be used as seen below:

In the example below, assume we have outputs defined in a `my-org/my-workspace`:

```hcl
data "tfe_outputs" "foo" {
  organization = "my-org"
  workspace = "my-workspace"
}

resource "random_id" "vpc_id" {
  keepers = {
    # Generate a new ID any time the value of 'bar' in workspace 'my-org/my-workspace' changes.
    bar = data.tfe_outputs.foo.values.bar
  }

  byte_length = 8
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `organization` - (Required) The name of the organization.
* `workspace` - (Required) The name of the workspace.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `values` - The current output values for the specified workspace.
* `nonsensitive_values` - The current non-sensitive output values for the specified workspace, this is a subset of all output values.
