# tfe_sentinel_policy

Sentinel Policy as Code is an embedded policy as code framework integrated
with Terraform Enterprise.

Policies are configured on a per-organization level, and are enforced on
all of an organization's workspaces during runs. Each plan's changes are
validated against the policy prior to the apply step.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```hcl
resource "tfe_sentinel_policy" "test" {
  name = "my-policy-name"
  organization = "my-org-name"
  policy = "main = rule { true }"
  enforce_mode = "hard-mandatory"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the policy.
* `organization` - (Required) Name of the organization.
* `policy` - (Required) The actual policy itself.
* `enforce_mode` - (Required) The enforcement level of the policy. Valid
  values are `advisory`, `hard-mandatory` and `soft-mandatory`. Defaults
  to `soft-mandatory`.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The ID of the policy.

## Import

Sentinel policies can be imported by concatenating the `organization name` and
`resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import tfe_sentinel_policy.test my-org-name/pol-wAs3zYmWAhYK7peR
```
