# tfe_data_retention_policy

Creates a data retention policy attached to either an organization or workspace. This resource is for Terraform Enterprise only.

## Example Usage

Creating a data retention policy for a workspace:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataRetentionPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/";
import { Organization } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/organization";
import { Workspace } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/workspace";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const testOrganization = new Organization(this, "test-organization", {
      email: "admin@company.com",
      name: "my-org-name",
    });
    const testWorkspace = new Workspace(this, "test-workspace", {
      name: "my-workspace-name",
      organization: testOrganization.name,
    });
    new DataRetentionPolicy(this, "foobar", {
      delete_older_than: [
        {
          days: 42,
        },
      ],
      workspace_id: testWorkspace.id,
    });
  }
}

```

Creating a data retention policy for an organization:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataRetentionPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/";
import { Organization } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/organization";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const testOrganization = new Organization(this, "test-organization", {
      email: "admin@company.com",
      name: "my-org-name",
    });
    new DataRetentionPolicy(this, "foobar", {
      delete_older_than: [
        {
          days: 1138,
        },
      ],
      organization: testOrganization.name,
    });
  }
}

```

Creating a data retention policy for an organization and exclude a single workspace from it:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataRetentionPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/";
import { Organization } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/organization";
import { Workspace } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/workspace";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const testOrganization = new Organization(this, "test-organization", {
      email: "admin@company.com",
      name: "my-org-name",
    });
    const testWorkspace = new Workspace(this, "test-workspace", {
      name: "my-workspace-name",
      organization: testOrganization.name,
    });
    new DataRetentionPolicy(this, "foobar", {
      delete_older_than: [
        {
          days: 1138,
        },
      ],
      organization: testOrganization.name,
    });
  }
}

```
