# {{.Name}}

This data source is used to retrieve the state outputs for a given workspace.
It enables output values in one Terraform configuration to be used in another.

As the outputs retrieved from a different workspace may contain sensitive
information in the context of that workspace, the `values` attribute of this
data source is statically marked as
[sensitive](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/outputs.html#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output).

## Example Usage 

Using the `tfe_outputs` data source, the outputs `foo` and `bar` can be used as seen below:

In the example below, assume we have outputs defined in a `my-org/my-workspace`:
